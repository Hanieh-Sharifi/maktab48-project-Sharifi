# This is an Ecommerce website with React
This is a single page website.

In this project, I'll use function components.

I'll use Redux.

I'll try to write comment for better understanding.

#
For UI and responsive I used Materal-UI and SASS.

For Icons I used Material-UI-Icons / React-Icons.

For API calls I used axios.

For notification I used React-toastify.

For charts I used rechart package.

For loading animations I used react-spinners package.

For animations I used Material-UI and framer-motion packages.

There's a package " why did you render" for checking pure components.

# packages list:
1- rechart

2- react-icons

3- redux-toolkit

4- react-router-dom

5- react-toastify

6- propTypes

7- node-sass

8- Material-UI

9- axios

10- react-spinners

11- redux-devtools-extension

12- why did you render

13- framer-motion
